# Client Canvas Research Pipeline

## Overview

The Client Canvas Research Pipeline is an advanced, AI-driven system designed to conduct comprehensive market research in the healthcare monitoring sector. This pipeline leverages the power of LlamaIndex and a multi-agent architecture to process complex research questions, gather and analyze data, and generate insightful reports.

## Features

- Multi-agent system for specialized research tasks
- Workflow-based approach for sequential processing
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for context-aware analysis
- Scalable vector storage for efficient data handling
- Modular architecture for easy extensibility

## System Architecture

The research pipeline consists of the following key components:

1. Orchestrator Agent: Manages the overall workflow and decides the next step in the research process.
2. Specialized Agents:
   - Problem Decomposition Agent
   - Knowledge Base Configuration Agent
   - Contextual Retrieval Agent
   - Data Validation Agent
   - Scenario Simulation Agent
   - Insight Generation Agent
   - Report Generation Agent
3. State Management: Keeps track of the research progress and intermediate results.
4. Document Loader: Handles ingestion of internal and external documents.

## Workflow

The research pipeline follows a sequential workflow:

1. Problem Decomposition
2. Knowledge Base Configuration
3. Contextual Retrieval
4. Data Validation
5. Scenario Simulation
6. Insight Generation
7. Report Generation
